# HomeAutomationUsingRaspberrypi

## Goal:
Application provides the features of  home  applicance management and security survelliance using Raspberry pi

## Introduction:
This  project  forwards  the  design  of  home  automation  and  security system  using Raspberry pi, a credit sized computer. Raspberry pi provides the features of a mini computer, additional with its GPIO pins where other components and devices can be connected. GPIO registers of raspberry pi are used for the output purposes.  We have design a power strip that can be easily connected to GPIO Pins of the Raspberry pi. The home appliances are connected to the input/output ports of Raspberry pi along with the power strip and their status is passed to the raspberry pi. The android running OS in any phone connected to a network can access the status of the home appliances via an application. It presents the design and implementation of automation system that can monitor and control home appliances via android phone or tablet.
